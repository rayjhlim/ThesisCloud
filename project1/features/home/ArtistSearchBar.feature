Feature: Artist Search Bar
	In order to prove that the artist search bar works
	on the home page, we need to test that each of its
	features work as intentended. 

Scenario: Navigate to homepage
	Given I am on the homepage
	Then I should see "SongCloud"
	And I should see an "input" element
	And I should see an "search" button

Scenario: Autocomplete suggestions are not selected
	Given I am on the homepage
	Then the "input" element should contain ""
	And the search bar should have a state of no selection

Scenario: Search box is editable
	Given I am on the homepage
	When I type "taylor" in the textbox
	Then I should see "taylor" in the search box

Scenario: Editing the search box should reset to no selection state
	Given I am on the homepage
	When I type "taylor" in the textbox
	And the search bar should have a state of no selection

Scenario: Typing in 3 characters should generate a list of autocomplete suggestions
	Given I am on the homepage
	And the search bar should have a state of no selection
	And there are more than 3 characters in the textbox
	Then I should see a drop down list

Scenario: If the user clicks on an artist from the suggestions drop-down, the textbox should be updated to contain the exact name of the selected artist, and the Artist Search Bar should adopt a state of YES-SELECTION
	Given I am on the homepage
	When I type "taylor" in the textbox
	Then I should see a drop down list
	When I click "Taylor Swift"
	Then I should see "Taylor Swift" in the search box
	And the search bar should have a state of yes selection
